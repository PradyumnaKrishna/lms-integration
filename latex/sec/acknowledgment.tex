I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor,\textbf{ Dr. T.V. Prabhakar}, for his invaluable guidance, mentorship, and unwavering support throughout the duration of this project. Dr. Prabhakar's expertise, insights, and encouragement have been instrumental in shaping the direction and execution of the LMS Integration with Namaste BHU project. His dedication to academic excellence and commitment to my growth as a researcher have been truly inspiring, and I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to learn from him.

I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to \textbf{Dev Angiras} for his constant support and invaluable assistance at every stage of the project. Dev's deep understanding of the Namaste BHU architecture, system architecture, and attention to detail have been instrumental in navigating the complexities of integration and ensuring the seamless functioning of the integrated platform. His tireless efforts, patience, and collaborative spirit have been indispensable, and I am immensely grateful for his unwavering dedication.
