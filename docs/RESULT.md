**Namaste BHU**

The Namaste BHU Architecture underwent updates and enhancements to facilitate seamless integration with Moodle. New features and functionalities were introduced in Namaste BHU to support single sign-on (SSO) through deep linking of the Moodle Mobile App. The updated Namaste BHU application serves as a central hub for accessing Moodle content, enabling users to seamlessly navigate between the two platforms and engage with course materials, announcements, and discussions. In the future, it will also deliver notifications from Moodle through Airnotifier.
